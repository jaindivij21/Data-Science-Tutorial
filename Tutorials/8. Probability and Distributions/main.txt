Distribution

1) Uniform Distribution
    In probability theory and statistics, the continuous uniform distribution or rectangular distribution is a family of symmetric probability distributions. 
    The distribution describes an experiment where there is an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bounds.

2) Normal Distribution
    Bell shaped distribution, Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean,
    showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. It is parameterized by Nue (Mean/Average) and Sigma (Standard Deviation).
        The probability near the mean is high when compared to probability near the edges or far away from the mean.
    
    Univariate Normal Distribution
    Here sigma or Standard Deviation basically is the amount of spread from the mean, Thus the formula for each value can be:
        x' = nue + sigma(x)
    
    Multivariate Normal Distribution
    A multivariate normal distribution is a vector in multiple normally distributed variables, such that any linear combination of the 
    variables is also normally distributed. It is mostly useful in extending the central limit theorem to multiple variables, but also has 
    applications to bayesian inference and thus machine learning, where the multivariate normal distribution is used to approximate the features
    of some characteristics; for instance, in detecting faces in pictures.

    Mean = Nue => [u1, u2, u3 ...]
    Deviation = Sigma => [s1, s2, s3 ...]
